# omicron-unity
A Unity3D package for using the Omicron input library for virtual reality devices.

The Omicron library provies access to a variety of input devices mostly used in immersive environments. The library is available at https://github.com/uic-evl/omicron.

This Unity3D package has two primary functions. The first is to provide access to these input devices by connecting to an Omicron oinputserver and receiving a stream of events. The scripts provided will convert the events for use within Unity.

The second function of this package is to provide a series of tools to aid in the development of Unity applications for virtual reality environments such as the Electronic Visualization Laboratory's CAVE2(TM).

CAVE2 is a trademark of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees
